    ADDING ICONS TO PAGE
        steps:
            1.) download and install "bootstrap-icons".
                a.) open terminal in your project 
                b.) switch to command prompt
                c.) type following cmd:
                    > npm install bootstrap-icons --save
                    (--save is given to save in package.json file, all libraries are installed here)

            2.) all icons are saved in a ".css" file.

            3.) you have to link the css file to webpage.
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="../node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css">

            4.) every icon will have a classname, you have to apply by using "class" attribute.
                you can apply icons to any container
                eg: 
                    <div class="bi bi-house">
                    <span class="bi bi-house"> 
                        - here bi stands for bootstrap icons and is always caleed like "bi bi-<iconname>"
            
            5.) to choose a icon you can get help from : 
                - www.getbootstarp.com  -> icons OR 
                                            ( go to icons.getbootstrap.com)
                                        -> serach your icon, eg: search "alarm" 
                                        -> click on icon 
                                        -> on right side you can get the classname of icon.
