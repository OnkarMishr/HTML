<!-- 
    1.) HTML staticc page have two extension :  ".html" or ".htm"  (But generally ".html" is recommended)
        FileName Standards: (eg: index.html)
            - Primary Name: 8 chars 
            - Secondary Name(OR Extension): 3 chars

        -> Note: Both are same(.html and .htm), But .htm is a per standards, Some software only follows the standards (eg: tutorials point has ".htm" extension)
        -> Note2: HTML can be designed with MS Word, Powerpoint, Excel -> just "save as webpage" while saving it.
-->


<!-- 
    2.) Static Page starts with document declaration:
-->
        <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- to tell the parser, that which version of HTML we are using. <!DOCTYPE html> tells the Engine/Browser that we are using HTML5 ,therefore, the browser also uses HTML5 parser.
                        if it(<!DOCTYPE html>) is not used html is of older versions(therfore not supporting some functions).
                        <!DOCTYPE html> : Not a DOCTYPE, it is HTML(HTML5). OR It tells that "it is not a tag, it is a document declaration." -->
        <!-- NOTE:
            <> :tells that it is a tag/token
            <!> :tells that it is not a tag/token
        -->


<!-- 
    3.) Page must contain DOCUMENT SCOPE:
        - Many "<html></html>" in same page is allowed, But note that the browser merges two(or multiple) html's into one html body. 
-->

<!-- 
    4.) A document can display content belonging to various relegional languages:
-->

        <html lang="en-IN"></html> <!-- language is English Indian -->
                                   <!-- USE:
                                        price in Rupees(₹) -> "en-IN" (English Indian)
                                        price in Dollars($) -> "en-US" (English USA)
                                    -->

<!--
    5.) Every html page has two sections:
    - html: not displayed in Browser but it is used in memory of browser -> ∵ we are not using head content, ∴ it(html content) is not displayed for better performance.
    - body: displayed directly into the browser.

        | HTML Page|       | Browser        |    | Memory         |
        | - head   |   =>  | - body(content)| =  | - head(content)|
        | - body   |       |                |    |                |
-->

<!--
    head
    - It contains content intended to load into browser memory.
    - It contains: title, link, meta, script, style.
-->

<!--
    Head:
    1.) Title:
        - It contains the text to display in browser's title.
        - It is also used in Bookmarks. (when you bookmark a page you save it(page) using this(anything written inside title tag) name only by default.)
    
    2.) Link:
        - used to link external file to webpage (- Shortcut-icon - also known as favicon ->"the icon at side of title of the page"   OR   
                                                 - Stylesheet)
            a.) Creating Shotuct icon/ favicon:
